codes developed in python during my doctorate studies

The scripts available in this repository consist of python projects (mostly Jupyter Notebook files) that were developed during my doctorate at applied mathematics. Some codes aim to solve actual problems, while others represent simple examples to get used to coding in python. 
The main goal of each project is to solve a given problem, as clearly as possible, considering the restrictions imposed by the physical model employed. Code readibility was also an important guideline, as well as the easiness of interpreting the results provided by each script. Computational efficiency, on the other hand, was not a major issue.
For this reason, in many cases there might be more efficient ways to perform the same computations.
